# Introduction

Prism is a high-performance system metrics collection and monitoring framework written in Rust. It provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for Linux systems through efficient procfs-based metric collection.

## What is Prism?

Prism is designed to be a lightweight, efficient, and extensible system monitoring solution that can collect various system metrics including:

- **CPU Metrics**: Core utilization, process statistics, context switches
- **Memory Metrics**: RAM usage, swap utilization, virtual memory statistics  
- **Disk Metrics**: I/O operations, storage utilization, filesystem statistics
- **Network Metrics**: Interface statistics, traffic analysis, connection metrics

## Key Features

### High Performance
- Written in Rust for maximum performance and memory safety
- Zero-cost abstractions and minimal runtime overhead
- Efficient procfs parsing with optimized data structures
- Async architecture for non-blocking operations

### Modular Architecture
