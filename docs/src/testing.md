# Testing

Prism includes a comprehensive testing framework designed to ensure reliability, accuracy, and performance of the metric collection system. The testing infrastructure consists of multiple layers, from unit tests for individual components to sophisticated integration tests that validate end-to-end functionality.

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach is built on several key principles:

### Accuracy First
Every metric collected by Prism must be accurate and verifiable. Our tests generate known data and verify that the parsing and processing logic produces exactly the expected results.

### Comprehensive Coverage
Testing covers all metric collection modules, data processing pipelines, and output formats to ensure no component is left unvalidated.

### Performance Validation
Tests verify not only correctness but also performance characteristics, ensuring Prism maintains low overhead and high throughput.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
Individual component testing for core functionality:
- Metric parsing logic
- Data structure operations
- Error handling and recovery
- Configuration management

### Integration Tests
End-to-end testing with realistic system data:
- Complete metric collection workflows
- Multi-module interaction testing
- Output format validation
- Performance benchmarking

## Running Tests

### Quick Test Run
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test module
cargo test -p prism-cpu
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Run integration tests
cargo run --bin procfs_integration_tests -- --count 10 --verbose

# Run with custom configuration
cargo run --bin procfs_integration_tests -- --count 5 --output test-results
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Profile memory usage
cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1
```

## Test Data Management

### Generated Test Data
Prism uses sophisticated data generation to create realistic test scenarios:
- Random but valid procfs file content
- Configurable system resource ranges
- Edge case and boundary condition testing

### Validation Methodology
Every test follows a strict validation process:
1. Generate known input data
2. Process data through Prism components
3. Verify output matches expected results
4. Check for performance regressions
5. Validate error handling behavior

### Full Test Suite
- Unit test execution across all modules
- Integration test validation
- Performance benchmark comparison
- Code coverage analysis
