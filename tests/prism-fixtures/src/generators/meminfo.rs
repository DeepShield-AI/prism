	/// which allocates 1 GB of memory (using malloc(3) or similar), but
	/// touches only 300 MB of that memory will show up as using only 300 MB of
	/// memory even if it has the address space allocated for the entire 1 GB.
	/// This 1 GB is memory which has been "committed" to by the VM and can be
	/// used at any time by the allocating application.  With strict overcommit
	/// enabled on the system (mode 2 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory),
	/// allocations which would exceed the CommitLimit will not be permitted.
	/// This is useful if one needs to guarantee that processes will not fail
	/// due to lack of memory once that memory has been successfully allocated.
